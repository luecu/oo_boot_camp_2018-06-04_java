OO Boot Camp in Java for Swiss client, 4-8 June 2018

Java is the most difficult to setup since there is a broad variety of Java
development tools (and versions). The following instructions are for installing
the code in IntelliJ 2017 by JetBrains. Adapt as necessary for your environment.

## IntelliJ setup
Note: The original was setup to use Java SDK 10

Open the reference code:
- Download the source code from github.com/fredgeorge
  - Clone, or pull and extract the zip
- Open IntelliJ
- Choose "Open"
- Navigate to the reference code root, and enter

Source and test directories should already be tagged as such:
- File/Project Structure...
- Select "Modules"
  - Tag src directory as Sources
  - Tag test directory as Tests
  - Click "OK"

Confirm that everything builds correctly (and necessary libraries exist)
